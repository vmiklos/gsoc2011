\section{Introduction}

The dm-mirror Linux kernel module is a software mirror implementation in the
Linux kernel, which is part of the device-mapper framework, most commonly used
for logical volume management (LVM\cite{lvm}).  The de facto common standard in industry
for software RAID in Linux environments is md-mirror nowadays, which is
independent from LVM.  My target is to improve dm-mirror in a way so that it's
feature set will be comparable (and then even better) to the already available
dm-mirror, while keeping it based on LVM.

My initial goal is to achieve fault tolerance and optimal performance in a
distributed storage setting with storage and network components having
different performance characteristics.

All my steps aim to converge the design and development dm-mirror in that
direction.

My motivation on doing measurements after the implementation is that the point
of those patches are to improve performance. Optimizing something only worths
it in case we optimize a bottleneck of a system and we can justify that we
achieved improved performance after applying the changes in question. Also,
given measurement results highly depend on various conditions, I took it
seriously to do my best to document most of the parameters on which the outcome
depends on. This is the reason why you can find a dedicated chapter later in
this report about measurements exclusively.

The measurements were done both in real-life and simulated environments. Both
are important to me:

\begin{itemize}
\item Real-life is what matters to end-users. Anything else is about to help
getting better results in real situations.
\item On the other hand, we can massively control various environment
parameters in simulated environments, which allows us to understand the system
better.
\end{itemize}

My approach here is to apply the idea of the model driven software development:
I saw the initial problem in real environment, I tried to make a simulated
environment, where I can reproduce the results and control parameters to point
out interesting effects and ignore the uninteresting ones, finally I validate
the model and apply the conclusions to the real-life situation.

If you look at the table of contents, you can see the measurement section is
quite long. That's not an accident, the results are explained in such a detail
in order to justify that the model I constructed is valid and parameters of the
measures are not subject of intentional distortion.

Also, you can see simulated results are detailed first. The reason for this is
that I first had to try different values of different parameters first to
understand the model of the system, and once I understood it, I did the
real-life measures to make sure the model I constructed is valid.

To give a summarized result before I detail each step and setup is that in some
conditions the read speed of a dm-mirror can be made about 14 times faster
after applying my changes, compared to the unpatched kernel. Please see the
section titled \emph{Read speed in simulated environment} for the precise
details.

\section{Background}

Most project laboratory specialized in dependable system design focus on making
a system more fault-tolerant, robust and reliable. This paper is not an
exception, though in addition to those goals, I care about performance a lot,
too.

High-level projects take I/O as a black box, and build something on top of it,
a typical example is a 3-layer application with a database, business logic and
presentation layer. This project focuses on I/O directly, without showing a
real-life benefit for the optimizations I made, partly because almost anything
on top of it is affected.

A part of making a system robust is to add redundancy to it - and this applies
to I/O as well. When adding redundancy to the I/O layer, the simplest method is
to use a mirror. A mirror can be a hardware or a software one. Given that
hardware mirror implementations usually are black boxes, I focus on software
mirror, and to be exact: the software mirror support of the Linux kernel, whose
source code can be freely modified and available without any charge.

Software mirror has two implementations in the Linux kernel:

\begin{itemize}
\item md-mirror is \emph{the} software mirror implementation most system
administrator aware of. It is separated from the device-mapper subsystem and it
is considered quite mature in the industry. Compared to dm-mirror, of course it
has missing features, for example it's not possible to resize the partitions
directly. One common workaround is to use md-mirror on top of linear logical
volumes.
\item dm-mirror on the other hand is a great vision: implement a software
mirror in the device-mapper framework, and take advantage of the framework's
already available features: the possibility to resize, crypt, and generally
modify volumes in a more comfortable way, compared to classic DOS partitions.
\end{itemize}

The problem in practice with dm-mirror is that it's less tested, it's less
actively developed, and it has problems which can be solved by even someone who
never touched kernel code before.

That's where I began the work. In the rest of this report I describe various
problems I found in connection with dm-mirror, present the implementation of
the fixes for some of those problems, perform measurements to justify my
results and finally point out possible future directors of related work.

\section{The problems of dm-mirror}

My initial problem is that in a distributed environment the local and the
remote nodes have different characteristics and this should be supported when
accessing device nodes. For example, when reading, it's important to use the
fastest node available, or - a sightly fine-grained method - use a weighted
approach to read more from faster nodes. It's also important to tolerate and
handle failures in a proper way, since those happen a lot in distributed
systems.

Having a look at the current dm-mirror\cite{lvmmirror}, I saw:

\begin{itemize}
\item The current read method is a Round-Robin algorithm, which is not capable
of proper handling of device nodes with different read speed.
\item Fault tolerance is in its initial stage: when a device node fails and
later recovers, manual action is needed, which takes time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}

The LVM mirror consists of multiple legs: all but one serves as a data storage,
and one does logging. This way the storage part of the mirror can be
represented as an array of logical device nodes - in case of two data and one
mirror leg, there will be two elements in the array. We index it from zero, so
the first element will have an index 0, then the second data leg will have an
index 1. The default mirror is the leg which is currently currently used for
reading.

When I read the source code of dm-mirror, I found two problems which seemed to
be relatively easy to fix:

\begin{itemize}
\item In case the two legs of the mirror have different read access, it's a
good idea to completely disable the Round-Robin algorithm and read from the
default mirror only.
\item In case the default mirror is not the fastest one, the user will want to
set the default mirror to a non-zero index value.
\end{itemize}

The current behaviour is that a number of read operations are done on one
device, then a switch occurs. The switch is done exactly when a limit is
reached - this is called \emph{rr\_ios\_set} in the source code. This number has
to be greater or equal to one at the moment.
What I did is the following: I extended it to support zero as a value as well, and in that case a switch never occurs.

The kernel part of the support code can be found in the appendix (first patch).

And then the user-space command to disable the switches is the following:

\begin{verbatim}
# dmsetup message myvg-mymirror 0 \
    io_balance round_robin ios 0
\end{verbatim}

The first zero is the identifier of the device, the second one is the number
introducing the real change.

The second problem is about: once we disabled automatic switches, we want to set the default mirror manually. To allow this, I created the second patch, which can be found in the appendix as well.

The user-space setting then can be used as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use \emph{lvs -a -o +devices} to list devices, the \emph{mimage} nodes will be the physical nodes of a mirror.
\item Once you have the right mimage, use \emph{dmsetup ls} to get the real device number, for example 253:3.
\item Finally use \emph{dmsetup message} to send the wished device number to the kernel
\end{itemize}

A possible commandline is:

\begin{verbatim}
# dmsetup message myvg-mymirror 0 io_balance default 253:3
\end{verbatim}

\section{Measurements}

I used the following setup for the tests:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=150mm,keepaspectratio]{testarch.eps}
\caption{Architecture of the test environment}
\end{figure}

The two machines were virtual ones, projlab2 hosted the LVM mirror, I ran all
timers there, finally that was the iSCSI initiator. The other box served as the
iSCSI target. Additionally I limited the bandwidth there, and I added the
network delay there as well.

I had two scripts to limit bandwidth and to add network delay to the traffic of
the iSCSI target.

The network delay part is more simple. To add some delay to each outgoing or
incoming package on the \emph{eth0} interface, the \emph{tc} command can be
used:

\begin{verbatim}
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms
\end{verbatim}

In case the delay is no longer necessary, a single command can remove the above
rule:

\begin{verbatim}
tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
\end{verbatim}

The Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control HOWTO\cite{lartc} explains the
\emph{tc} command in more detail.

There are multiple ways to limit bandwidth. And older technique is Class Based
Queueing, a newer one is Hierarchy Token Bucket. In short, HTB is a successor
to CBQ, see its documentation\cite{htb} fore more details.

The LARC HOWTO even provides a ready to use script to limit bandwidth, I used
that without any major modifications.

It's important to consider why these two parameters model well a real life
situation where a device is on a Wide Area Network. The Linux
Foundation\cite{netem} has a great article in this topic. They collected the following network problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item delay
\item rate
\item packet loss
\item packet duplication
\item packet corruption
\item packet reordering
\end{itemize}

Given that we are interested in the high-level iSCSI behaviour, the packet
problems can be simply simulated with a slow network bandwidth. So a good
approach is to control the network delay and the bandwidth available, and that
should cover the other aspects.

\subsection{Read speed in simulated environment}

First I checked the read time of a 2MB-sized file without network latency and
with 200ms delay over an iSCSI device node. I following table and chart
demonstrate the results (all numbers are in seconds, unless otherwise stated):

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
Type & Time \\ \hline
Local read & 0.03 \\
Remote read & 17.642 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Local and remote reads with network latency}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{charts/1_63947f00.eps}
\caption{Comparing local and remote reads with network latency}
\end{figure}

The reason for such a huge difference with 200ms latency is that this delay is
meant for each package, while the transferred data is 2MB.

Then I measured read speed of 2MB data on a mirror (every result is the average
of 3 individual measures):

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
Type & m1 (s) & m2 (s) & m3(s) & avg (s) \\ \hline
Default (RR, n=128) with delay & 9.385 & 0.274 & 1.135 & 3.598 \\
Local only & 0.282 & 0.259 & 0.224 & 0.255 \\
Remote without delay & 1.262 & 2.004 & 1.644 & 1.636 \\
Remote with delay & 22.826 & 20.225 & 13.339 & 18.796 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mirror read speed of 2MB data}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{charts/7_69a4ab34.eps}
\caption{Comparing mirror read speed of 2MB data}
\end{figure}

As expected, the fastest method is doing all reads on the local node exclusively.

By remote "with" or "without" delay, I mean that in the first situation I used
the \emph{tc} tool to add some simulated delay, while in the second case I
didn't use such a tool, so basically there were no delay. (Because the two
virtual machines were on the same physical host.)

It makes sense to calculate if the results are approximately valid before we
continue. The total delay of packages from the above table is 17.160s. If the
delay for each logical package is 200ms, that should mean about 86 logical
packages. By logical, I mean I don't count physical fragmentation of the IP
packages.  When I recorded the network traffic with \emph{tcpdump}, then I got
70 packages having the TCP PUSH flag (last physical IP package of a logical
write). The difference is measure error, we already saw above that the result
varies a bit each time we repeat the test. As a result, sadly it's not entirely
possible to exactly repeat the same test with and without network delay.

You may ask: in case \emph{tc} simply delays the last physical package of a
local write (the one with a PUSH flag), is this realistic? I think so, because
in reality the fragments of a logical write are sent almost at the same time,
so the delays are parallel. For example in case we send 20 physical fragments,
then the real delay will be only a bit more than the delay for a single package
- the key is that we wait for an ACK after the end of a logical write, but we
do not wait for an ACK after sending each fragments.

One could also note, that - of course - if the delay generated by \emph{tc}
would not be realistic, it would not make any sense.

Now that we understand the difference between remote reads with and without
network delay, let's compare the other results. Reading using Round Robin (with
delay) is slower than a remote read without delay, we expected that. Also,
reading from remote with delay is slower than reading from local and remote
(what RR does) as well, so the results show what we would predict.

\subsection{Write speed in simulated environment}

First I measured write speed with different network bandwidth available. In this case no LVM technique was involved, I used plain scp to copy data projlab2 to iscsitarget:

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
Type & Time \\ \hline
10kbit & 22.951 \\
100mbit & 1.705 \\
unlimited & 1.767 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Network write speed with 2MB of data}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{charts/2_5fabe87e.eps}
\caption{Comparing network write speed with 2MB of data}
\end{figure}

From now, I measured mirror write speed of 2MB data, with various parameters.

\subsubsection{Singe log, local log, local disks}

Setup: I created myvg from sdb, sdc and sdd, then mymirror on top of myvg.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{setup1.eps}
\caption{Architecture of single log, local log, local disks}
\end{figure}

That is a single measurement (3 times, and then counting the average in seconds): 0.591, 0.603, 0.588 - average: 0.594.

Tear down: I removed myvg.

\subsubsection{Single log, remote log, local and remote disk, different ratios}

By different ratios, I mean limiting network bandwidth different way. I want to
clarify the connection between logical ratios and exact network speeds I used:

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
Logical ratio & physical speed (kilobits) \\ \hline
1:2 & 50000 \\
1:5 & 20000 \\
1:10 & 10000 \\
1:50 & 2000 \\
1:100 & 1000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of different network bandwidth ratios and physical speeds}
\end{table}
\end{center}

Setup: I created sdb1 and sdb1 on iscsitarget and started the daemon there.

Then I configured the client, the new devices nodes here are sdf1 and sdf2.

Finally I configured the mirror named mymirror from sdb, sdf1 and sdf2.

\begin{figure}[H]

1:5 & 21.716 & 23.399 & 23.503 & 22.872 \\
1:10 & 38.133 & 38.124 & 36.606 & 37.621 \\
1:50 & 47.035 & 48.205 & 47.688 & 47.642 \\
1:100 & 49.633 & 48.240 & 48.057 & 48.643 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{charts/3_5e6daa6.eps}
\caption{Comparing network write speed with single log, remote log, local and remote disk, different ratios}
\end{figure}

Tear down: I disabled bandwidth limitation.

\subsubsection{Single log, remote log, local and remote disk, different delays}

No setup, the mirror was already there.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l |}

50ms & 2.649 & 2.622 & 2.759 & 2.676 \\
100ms & 6.067 & 3.517 & 3.441 & 4.341 \\
200ms & 16.352 & 13.930 & 10.392 & 13.558 \\

\end{figure}

Tear down: I disabled the simulation of network latency, then removed myvg.

\subsubsection{Single log, local log, local and remote disk, different ratios}

Setup: I created mymirror from sdb, sdf1 and sdc.

\begin{figure}[H]

Tear down: I disabled bandwidth limitation.

\subsubsection{Single log, local log, local and remote disk, different delays}

No setup, the mirror is the same as with the previous test.

\end{figure}

Tear down: I disabled network latency, then removed myvg.

\subsubsection{Mirrored log, local disks}

For now, I tested this on my RHEL5 machine where I already had the backported
lvm2 from Fedora rawhide. This has the benefit that other components of the system
is not changed. The downside is that this way the measurement is less official,
since then this is a custom system.

Setup: I created myvg from sdb, sdc, sdd and sde.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=75mm,keepaspectratio]{setup4.eps}
\caption{Architecture of mirrored log, local disks}
\end{figure}

That is a single measurement (3 times, and then counting the average in seconds):
3.183, 3.181, 3.195, average: 3.186.

Tear down: I removed myvg.

\subsubsection{Mirrored log, local and remote disk, different ratios}

Tear down: I disabled network latency, then removed myvg.

\subsection{Write speed in a real-life environment}

I did the same test in a real environment. The test is the same: I wrote 2MB of
data to the mirror. The results are still in seconds.

\subsubsection*{Single log, remote log, local and remote disks}

I could not change the parameters here, so I simply did the test 3 times: 12.106, 12.586, 12.784; average: 12.49.

\subsubsection*{Single log, local log, local and remote disks}

Same here (not possible to change parameters), the results: 11.706, 12.996, 12.445; average: 12.38.

\subsubsection*{Mirrored log, local and remote disks}

The results: 12.337, 12.476, 12.896; average: 12.56.

\subsection{Read speed in real-life environment}

I repeated the read speed tests in real-life environment as well. The amount of
read data is still 2MB, the results are in seconds:

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline
Type & m1 (s) & m2 (s) & m3(s) & avg (s) \\ \hline
Default (RR, n=128) & 2.518 & 0.993 & 2.049 & 1.85 \\
Local only & 0.058 & 0.043 & 0.044 & 0.04 \\
Remote only & 3.771 & 3.465 & 3.349 & 3.52 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Validating our model}

In this subsection, I want to proof that our model to represent network delays
and bandwidth limitations is valid. I measured the network ratio and delay of
the real-life environment, set up the simulated environment with the measured
parameters and compared the results.

\subsubsection*{The delay}

I measured the ICMP echo request response time of the remote \emph{sy.ulx.hu}
machine and of the virtual \emph{iscsitarget}.

The result of the differences: (28.8+31.2+32.1)/3-(2.12+0.459+0.358)/3 =
29.73ms.

\subsubsection*{The bandwidth}

Writing 2MB of data takes 11.839s: (2*1024*8)/11.839=1383.90 kilobits/s.

I measure the simulated system with the above parameters and I compare the
results I got to the real-life ones. Please see the previous \emph{Write speed
in real-life environment} section for more details.

\subsubsection*{Single log, remote log, local and remote disks}

Expected (in seconds): 12.49.

Got: (15.006+14.778+14.991)/3 = 14.92.

\subsubsection*{Single log, local log, local and remote disks}

Expected: 12.38.

Got: (14.581+14.931+14.717)/3 = 14.74.

\subsubsection*{Mirrored log, local and remote disks}

Expected: 12.56.

Got: (15.071+14.658+14.755)/3 = 14.82.

In each case the simulated environment had an acceptable difference to the real
one.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The measured numbers are not always the ones we expected, though generally they are OK, I think.
\item One false effect is that \emph{sync} does not do empty the write cache on the \emph{iscsitarget} (remote) node.
\item In general, I would say the mirrored log is a nice feature, as that way
the two leg of the mirror can be really identical.

On the other hand, it seems to be a huge overhead. This means that in case
dm-mirror is running on one machine only, it is not a major benefit. This is
because in case dm-mirror has a single local log, that's already enough.

Note: dm-mirror is running on multiple boxes in cluster environments, so it
still makes sense to have mirrored logs in those cases.
\end{itemize}

I also want to point out that the measurements above show us that any network
bandwidth slowness or network delay massively enlarges the read and write time
of the mirror (in case it has remote parts). This means it's quite important to
be able to optimize reading from such mirrors: when we write, we must write to
all legs of a mirror, but when we read, we should do our best to read from the
local leg, whenever possible. And this is basically what my modification in the
dm-mirror driver does - even if it's a small modification, it may cause radical
speedups in some situations.

\section{Future work}

I basically have three ideas on where could I continue:

\begin{itemize}
\item Even though I already did some measurement, more could be necessary. Maybe a more automated setup would provide better numbers. The current measures were executed manually, then I had to copy the numbers to this document, finally I manually created the charts as well. This may worth more automatism.
\item I could do further research on how to improve performance. For example it would be possible to let the dm-mirror kernel module handle do weighted RR, in case a simple RR is suboptimal, but reading from a single disk only isn't the best, either.
\item Finally, sooner or later it will be important to add support for storing the RR number and the default mirror device in the LVM metadata.
\end{itemize}

If it's up to me, I would say the last one is the more interesting, since
currently the dmsetup commands have to be put to some init script which is
executed on startup any time, which is a bit ugly.
