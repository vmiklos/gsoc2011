This is a mod_python script that converts your asciidoc blog to an RSS feed.

Before you run it, don't forget to read the source, you need to customize at least:

- the rndcache path (search for "rndcache" - with quotes; make sure that is
  writable by the webserver, don't be afraid of using an absolute path)
- the url of the plaintext file
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~vmiklos/lo-gsoc/tree/README?h=diary
  in my case)

If you use apache, the htaccess.sample file can help you when you write your .htaccess file for the script.

With some Python knowledge, you'll figure out the rest. :-)
