regularly check for:

- undocumented classes
- missing license headers

general (more or less sorted):

- [done] hello world
- [done] character props
- [done] character styles
- [done] paragraph props
- [done] unicode support
- [done] numberings
- [done] picture
- [done] tables (simple + nested)
- [done] sections
- [done] headers and footers
- [done] headers/footers vs styles
- [done] section-borders
- [done] footnotes
- [done] line numbering
- [done] bookmarks
- [done] toc
- [done] redlines
- [done] fields
- [done] drawing objects
- [done] forms
- [done] ole objects: replacement graphics
- [done] ole objects: load native data

missing dmapper support:
- protected sections (sections.rtf)
- page breaks: even/odd ones (sections.rtf)
- make DomainMapper_Impl::PushPageHeader handle "left" and "all" headers separately for rtf
- NS_ooxml::LN_EG_SectPrContents_pgNumType is completely ignored (page numbering style, restart)
- ole object: convert native data (mathtype->mathml, etc), like the ww8 import does
- crop of images is ignored
