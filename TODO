regularly check for:

- undocumented classes
- missing license headers

general (more or less sorted):

- [done] hello world
- [done] character props
- [done] character styles
- [done] paragraph props
- [done] unicode support
- [done] numberings
- [done] picture
- [done] tables (simple + nested)
- [done] sections
- headers and footers
- headers/footers vs styles
- section-borders
- headers/footers vs page numbering (restart, etc)
- footnotes
- line numbering
- bookmarks
- toc
- redlines
- drawing objects
- forms
- fields
- ole objects in general (e.g charts, at least the image)
- math (would be nice to be able to edit as well)

smaller tasks:

- bookmarks vs tables
- outline numbering
- stylenames vs spec rtf chars
- textframes

missing uno api:
- paragraph props: vertical alignment
- protected sections
- page breaks: even/odd ones
