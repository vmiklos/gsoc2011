regularly check for:

- undocumented classes
- missing license headers

general (more or less sorted):

- [done] hello world
- [done] character props
- [done] character styles
- [done] paragraph props
- [done] unicode support
- [done] numberings
- [done] picture
- [done] tables (simple + nested)
- [done] sections
- [done] headers and footers
- [done] headers/footers vs styles
- [done] section-borders
- [skip] headers/footers vs page numbering (restart, etc)
- [done] footnotes
- [done] line numbering
- [done] bookmarks
- [done] toc
- [done] redlines
- [done] fields
- [done] drawing objects
- [done] forms
- [done] ole objects - replacement graphics
- math (would be nice to be able to edit as well)

smaller tasks:

- bookmarks vs tables
- outline numbering
- [skip] textframes + nested flies (handle the error properly)

misc:
- migrate unit tests
- copypaste should use the new filter in experimental mode

missing dmapper support:
- paragraph props: vertical alignment
- protected sections
- page breaks: even/odd ones
- make DomainMapper_Impl::PushPageHeader handle "left" and "all" headers separately for rtf
- NS_ooxml::LN_EG_SectPrContents_pgNumType is completely ignored (page numbering style, restart)
- PAGEREF field is not supported
- comments: author name and date is not supported
- text frames [ 13:28 <@cbosdonnat> vmiklos: ok... 3.3 was still creating the frames but w/o the text in them... and master doesn't create the frames at all :( ]
