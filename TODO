regularly check for:

- undocumented classes
- missing license headers

general (more or less sorted):

- [done] hello world
- [done] character props
- [done] character styles
- paragraph props
- numberings
- picture
- tables (simple + nested)
- sections
- headers and footers
- headers/footers vs styles
- section-borders
- headers/footers vs page numbering (restart, etc)
- footnotes
- line numbering
- bookmarks
- toc
- redlines
- drawing objects
- forms
- fields
- ole objects in general (e.g charts, at least the image)
- math (would be nice to be able to edit as well)

smaller tasks:

- bookmarks vs tables
- unicode accents (LO 3.3+)
- legacy accents (Go-OO 3.2 used to emit such)
- outline numbering
- stylenames vs spec rtf chars
- import of doc starting with a table (that was a special case with the export)
- textframes

would be nice to have:

- \ldblquote and \rdblquote are both parsed as "
